# Bitseed protocol introduction

Bitseed aims to extend the capabilities of the Ordinals protocol, making Inscription more conveniently used in full-chain games and Autonomous Worlds.

## The World Originates from a Seed

We believe that any game world can be generated through a Generator and a Seed. This Seed, formed by the hash values of Bitcoin blocks and transactions, ensures that each generated world is unique. We can utilize the Seed provided by Bitcoin to generate assets, props, characters, and worlds in the game.
