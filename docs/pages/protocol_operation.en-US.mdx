# Protocol Operations

Within the Bitseed protocol, a series of operations have been defined to ensure the efficient and consistent management and transfer of assets on the blockchain. Below is a detailed technical description of these operations:

## Deploy Operation

The Deploy operation is responsible for initializing and deploying new asset types or game worlds, inscribing specific generator metadata on the blockchain, specifying how to generate and restrict assets. This includes the location identifier of the generator (for example, a URI pointing to an Inscription), the maximum supply (max), and the allowed number of duplicate generations (repeat).

Below are two examples of deploying Bitseed assets:

```json
{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "op": "deploy",
    "tick": "bits",
    "max": 210000000000,
    "generator": "/content/$inscription_id",
}

{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "op": "deploy",
    "tick": "seed",
    "repeat": 1,
    "generator": "/content/$inscription_id",
}
```

The following table lists the properties of the Bitseed deploy instruction:

| Attribute       | Description                                                                          | Required |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ---------|
| p               | Protocol name, must be "bitseed"                                                     | Yes|
| op              | Operation name, must be "deploy"                                                     | Yes|
| tick            | Type, 4-32 characters, case-insensitive                                              | Yes|
| max             | Maximum supply, an integer, with no upper limit by default                           | No |
| repeat          | Allowed number of duplicates, default is 0, indicating no limit on repeats           | No |
| generator       | The address of the generator, pointing to another Inscription                        | Yes|
| has_user_input  | Whether user input is required, default is false,true indicates user input is needed | No |
| deploy_args     | Deployment parameters for the initialization of the generator, array of JSON strings | No |

## Mint Operation

The content for Mint is generated by the generator program. Users inscribe it into the content field of the inscription and set the corresponding content_type identifier to `application/json`.

```json
{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "tick": "bits",
    "amt": 100,
}

{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "tick": "seed",
    "amt": 1,
    "attributes": {
        "seed": "0xabcd"
    } 
}
```

## Transfer Operation

The Transfer operation follows the UTXO tracking model of the Inscription protocol, supporting the transfer of Bitseed assets from one address to another.
   
## Merge Operation

The Merge operation allows for the combination of two Bitseed assets of the same type into a single asset. The merging assets (A, B) must have the same protocol identifier (p), asset type (tick), and attributes (attributes). The quantity (amt) of the new merged asset (C) is the sum of the quantities of the original assets.
The Merge operation requires the UTXOs of the two original Inscriptions to be output to the same Output and inscribed again.

```text
A.p == B.p
A.tick == B.tick
A.attributes == B.attributes
C.amt = A.amt + B.amt
```

For example, currently there is Bitseed A 
```json
{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "tick": "bits",
    "amt": 100,
}
```

Bitseed B

```json
{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "tick": "bits",
    "amt": 200,
}
```

After merging A and B, the result is

```json
{
    "p": "bitseed",
    "tick": "bits",
    "amt": 300,
}
```

## Split Operation

The Split operation allows a Bitseed asset to be divided into multiple independent assets. The original asset (C) is split into two or more assets (A, B), with attributes remaining unchanged, while the quantity is distributed according to the split rules.
The Split operation requires the UTXO of the original Inscription to be output to two Outputs and inscribed separately.

```text
C.amt > 1
C.amt == A.amt + B.amt
A.tick = C.tick
B.tick = C.tick
A.attributes = C.attributes
B.attributes = C.attributes
```
